A website made using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Flask to recommend anime. We used KNN and K-Means algorithms to give three kinds of recommendations - based on genre, based on user ratings and finally the top recommendations.

## Dataset

We used the Anime Recommendations Database available on Kaggle here - https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/anime-recommendations-database.
This data set contains information on user preference data from 73,516 users on 12,294 anime. Each user is able to add anime to their completed list and give it a rating and this data set is a compilation of those ratings.
